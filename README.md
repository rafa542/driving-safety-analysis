# Driving Safety Analysis

This was my final project for Virginia Tech's CS 3654: Introductory Data Analytics and Visualization course.

I decided to do my project on vehicle safety. I used a data set with 26,217 observations and 15 variables. The data was collected using the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National Automotive Sampling System (NASS). The data was originally scrapped by researchers at the Colorado State University to investigate the effectivness of airbas. However, I thought the data could shed insight into other patterns in driving safety.

The dataset captures US data, for 1997-2002, from police-reported car crashes in which there is a harmful event (people or property), and from which at least one vehicle was towed. Data are restricted to front-seat occupants, include only a subset of the variables recorded, and are restricted in other ways also.
